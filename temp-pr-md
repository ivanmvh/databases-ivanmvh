## Learning objectives
- Use primary key & foreign key mechanism for joining tables.
- Query multiple tables.
- Prepare complex queries that answer analytical questions.

## Description
In this project we will add some new tables and add foreign key columns to our existing `animals` table to model **one-to-many** relationships. Afterward, we will use `JOIN` to query the data.

### General requirements

- Make sure that we used correct Gitflow.
- Make sure that we documented our work in a professional way.

### Project requirements
- Create a table named `owners` with the following columns:
  - `id`: integer (set it as autoincremented PRIMARY KEY)
  - `full_name`: string
  - `age`: integer

- Create a table named `species` with the following columns:
  - `id`: integer (set it as autoincremented PRIMARY KEY)
  - `name`: string

- Modify `animals` table:
  - Make sure that id is set as autoincremented PRIMARY KEY
  - Remove column `species`
  - Add column `species_id` which is a foreign key referencing `species` table
  - Add column `owner_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `owners` table

- Remember all this goes in `schema.sql` file.

- Insert the following data into the `owners` table:
  - Sam Smith 34 years old.
  - Jennifer Orwell 19 years old.
  - Bob 45 years old.
  - Melody Pond 77 years old.
  - Dean Winchester 14 years old.
  - Jodie Whittaker 38 years old.

- Insert the following data into the `species` table:
  - Pokemon
  - Digimon

- Modify our inserted animals so it includes the `species_id` value:
  - If the name ends in "mon" it will be Digimon
  - All other animals are Pokemon

- Modify our inserted animals to include owner information (`owner_id`):
  - Sam Smith owns Agumon.
  - Jennifer Orwell owns Gabumon and Pikachu.
  - Bob owns Devimon and Plantmon.
  - Melody Pond owns Charmander, Squirtle, and Blossom.
  - Dean Winchester owns Angemon and Boarmon.

- Remember these insertions and modifications happen in `data.sql` file.

- Write queries (using `JOIN`) to answer the following questions:
  - What animals belong to Melody Pond?

  - List of all animals that are pokemon (their type is Pokemon).

  - List all owners and their animals, remember to include those that don't own any animal.

  - How many animals are there per species?

  - List all Digimon owned by Jennifer Orwell.

  - List all animals owned by Dean Winchester that haven't tried to escape.

  - Who owns the most animals?

- Remember all these should be written in `queries.sql` file.
